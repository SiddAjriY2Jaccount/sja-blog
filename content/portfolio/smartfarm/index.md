A prototype of a self sustained Iot-controlled Hydroponics Farm was developed, using Arduino and Raspberry Pi, which acts as a remote server, hosting a Web application through which the entire farm could be controlled. Through continuous monitoring of sensor values, the 'smart' functionality of the Farm was achieved. Few of the features of this Farm includes self powered through use of solar tracking panels, panels arranged in the form of a Flower to also allow for rain water harvesting, self induced irrigation through monitoring moisture sensor readings and also adjusting LED grow light intensity according to the crop being grown. 
This project won 3rd place and Best Idea awards at Kludge Hackathon 2018 as well as qualified for the Final Round at Rajasthan Hackathon/Greenathon 2018.

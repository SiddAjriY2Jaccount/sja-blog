- Wrote Python wrappers for stock trading libraries such as 'nowtrade' and 'ta-lib' to extend their functionalities to include more technical indicators such as DEMA, BBANDS, Supertrend, MACD etc. and graphical visualizations of stock data, as well as, the indicators using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Exploring Apache Spark: Tasked with executing above mentioned extensions of stock trading libraries on Databricks to leverage Spark to carry out technical indicator calculation as a Spark job.
- Exploring Apache Kafka: Leveraging Apache Kafka to develop an anomaly alerting system, with each process in isolated Docker containers.

In what was my first internship experience, I worked at Innointel Global as a Data Science Intern. I was tasked with developing a relevance classification pipeline for the IESM project. Multiple datasets of websites and their summaries were compiled and the website needed to be classified as relevant to a domain mentioned such as 'Science & Technology' or 'Manufacturing' etc. The pipeline and model developed as part of the internship was directly responsible for pushing deliverables of relevance classification for 42k data points.

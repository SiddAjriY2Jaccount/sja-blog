I'm a Deep Learning, AI and Computer Vision enthusiast and have taken small steps towards exploring my interests in these fields by contributing to Research projects in my college. So far, I have indulged myself in Python development, IoT and Data Science projects. 

Apart from academics, I greatly enjoy any creatively stimulating process, which might explain my love for scriptwriting and storytelling, two of my favourite hobbies. I'm a huge sports fan, especially Soccer and Cricket. In my free time, I immerse myself in physical activities such as Cycling or going to the Gym. 

My only known weakness is Pizza. :pizza:

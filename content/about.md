My name is **Siddhanth Jayaraj Ajri**. Most people call me 'Sidd' or 'Siddhanth' or 'Ajri'. I am from the city of Bangalore in India. I am currently pursuing my **MS in Computer Science** from **Northeastern University** in Boston, MA.

Previously, I've held a Full-time position as a Project Engineer at Wipro in their Open Source Software department, as part of the CTO Office. I also hold an undergraduate Bachelor's in Engineering degree (B.E.) in Computer Science Engineering from **PESIT Bangalore South Campus**, having graduated in August 2020. I was also the proud co-founder of [Vincere Solutions] (https://www.vincere-solutions.com). 

My main areas of interest/expertise are Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Full-Stack development and DevOps. My goal is to build my career in the intersection of these domains, creating Production ready, full-stack ML applications that are designed keeping in mind best practices of software engineering. I'm also a proponent of Open Source and try to contribute to the OSS community as much as possible. 

Apart from academics, I greatly enjoy any creatively stimulating process, which might explain my love for scriptwriting and storytelling, two of my favourite hobbies. I'm a huge sports fan, especially Soccer and Cricket. In my free time, I immerse myself in physical activities such as Cycling or going to the Gym. 

My only known weakness is Pizza. :pizza:

Here are some explanations about the portfolio FrontMatter:
- `jobDate` is the year displayed on the list and show of your project
- `work` is displayed on the list of projects. It is an array of type of job that you did on the project.
- `techs` and `designs` are displayed on the show page of your project. It is an array of tools you used on the project
- `thumbnail` is a image file displayed both for the list and show of the project
- `projectUrl` is the URL to the project.
- The `testimonial` params define the person giving your a testimonial as well as the text of the testimonial.

NB: if `techs`, `designs` or `projectUrl` is not defined, it will not be displayed at all.

The purpose of this research was to develop a light-weight model that achieves fairly accurate results for FER in Children. Furthermore, through experimentation, we were able to find the differentiating features between Children and Adults for FER as well as determine the optimal, lowest number of key Facial Landmark points required to be plotted for FER.
